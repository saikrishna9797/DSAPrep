The NOT IN clause can fail when the subquery returns even one NULL value. This is a well-known SQL quirk.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

select id,
case
    when p_id is null then 'Root'
    when id not in (select p_id from Tree where p_id is not null) then 'Leaf'
    else 'Inner'
end as type
from Tree;
